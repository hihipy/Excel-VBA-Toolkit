# 📘 Excel-VBA-Toolkit (`.bas` Modules)

This repository contains a curated set of Excel VBA macros, organized as `.bas` code modules for easy reuse and import into any Excel workbook.

These macros are designed for:
- ✅ **Data cleaning** and transformation
- ✅ **Smart exports** (CSV, Markdown) with advanced formatting
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** of PivotTables and Excel Tables
- ✅ **Utility functions** for hyperlink extraction and data manipulation

All files are stored as **plain-text `.bas` modules**, which can be imported directly into Excel's VBA editor.

## 📂 What Are `.bas` Files?

`.bas` files are **VBA code modules** exported from Excel. They contain reusable procedures (macros) that can be imported into other Excel workbooks. Each `.bas` file in this repo corresponds to a specific macro or functional category (e.g., exports, utilities).

## 📌 Macro Descriptions

Detailed summaries of what each `.bas` file in the toolkit does:

### 🧹 Data Cleaning

- **`DeleteHiddenRowsOptimized.bas`**  
  Efficiently deletes all hidden rows in the active worksheet using a bottom-up approach. Features real-time progress tracking, execution time reporting, and optimized performance for large datasets (50,000+ rows). Perfect for cleaning filtered data before analysis or export.

- **`FillBlanksDown.bas`**  
  Intelligently fills blank cells in a selected range with values from the cell directly above. Handles merged cells gracefully and provides detailed feedback on cells modified. Essential for cleaning pivot table exports or grouped data where labels are omitted in repeated rows.

---

### 📊 Exports & Documentation

- **`DocumentTableFormulas.bas`**  
  Creates comprehensive Markdown documentation of all Excel Tables (ListObjects) and their formulas. Categorizes formula types (SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, etc.), detects cross-table references, and exports to `Downloads\Table_Formulas_AI.txt`. Ideal for formula auditing and AI-assisted code generation.

- **`DocumentAllTables.bas`**  
  Generates detailed metadata documentation for every Excel Table in the workbook. Includes table structure, column data types, sample values, potential relationships, and suggested formulas. Outputs comprehensive Markdown suitable for data dictionaries and technical documentation.

- **`ExportPivotToMarkdown.bas`**  
  Exports the first PivotTable on the active worksheet to GitHub-compatible Markdown format. Preserves table structure with proper pipe delimiters and escapes special characters. Perfect for documentation, reports, or sharing pivot analysis in markdown-friendly platforms.

- **`ExportRangeToCSV.bas`**  
  Advanced CSV export tool with intelligent data type detection, configurable text quoting, and buffered writing for optimal performance. Handles 50,000+ rows efficiently while preserving data integrity. Supports custom delimiters and provides detailed export statistics.

- **`GenerateAdvancedPivotReport.bas`**  
  Creates comprehensive documentation for all PivotTables (both OLAP and regular) in a workbook. Includes field configurations, data sources, OLAP connection details, MDX references, calculated fields, and slicer information. Outputs detailed Markdown reports with complete metadata analysis.

---

### 🔧 Utilities

- **`GetHyperlinkURL.bas`**  
  Custom Excel function that extracts the actual URL from hyperlinked cells. Use with `=GetHyperlinkURL(A1)` to retrieve hyperlink addresses for link inventories, validation, or export lists. Includes error handling for non-hyperlinked cells and multiple cell selections.
